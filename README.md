# nord-external
A roblox external cheat developed by myself and nicholas. The majority of this project was developed by me and nick came around much later with his contributions. This source code is free and avalible to everyone because I've given up on this project and have decided to persue my personal endevours (these include other projects too!). 

Feel free to use this code for whatever you want, I don't care anymore.

### Credits
- xgladius - glad-ext
- nicholas - a great UI
- iivillian - introduced me to the render_list system and coding style.
